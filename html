                As she strides with anticipation into the unfamiliar, pristine pale gray office, she can not help but wonder of the possible success that might transpire with a new position in her profession. After the passing of various months, she discovers that her male counterparts’ incomes are significantly higher. This is an extremely frequent occurrence and because of this, women, especially those of minority groups face great inequalities regarding their occupations. This site is dedicated to bringing awareness to the struggles that women face in the field of STEM.

                This lack of representation has been alive for a tremendously long time, predominantly in earlier decades. Females were not given many educational opportunities, restricting their access to information as well as technology. This was because of expected gender roles and stereotypes. Even women who would finish their education, would not be given the option of full-time employment.

                <br> Stereotypes: STEM  skills are seen as less-feminine from ages as young as four years old. These skills are not typically developed or nurtured for women.
                <br> Male-Dominated: Since more males work in STEM, these fields target men and appeal to them more than they would do for women. Some of these workforces demonstrate characteristics of exclusion and inflexibility.
                <br> Decreasing Amount of Influence: Girls from a young age do not have enough role models to help inspire or provoke interest for different fields in STEM. Females of color, having an even more difficult time with this.

The algorithm for Charles Babbage’s analytical engine was constructed by her, which would  later output Bernoulli numbers. At the young age of thirty-six, she died of uterine cancer, but her works greatly aided the development of computer science.</p>

Curie’s work primarily focused on radioactivity, as well as the discovery of several radioactive elements. Curium was named after Marie Curie after her death in 1944 in honor to her. </p>

She worked for NASA during the space race in opposition to the Soviet Union. She and her colleagues were often known as “human computers” due to their expertise in mathematics. The calculations she made were critical to putting people in the United States of America in orbit. This great accomplishment was a majority of the reason how humans were able to travel to the moon. </p>

It eventually created the base of our knowledge of the fundamental workings of microscopic things such as  DNA, RNA, and viruses. Franklin used X-ray crystallography to observe the helix shape of DNA. She died early at the age of thirty-seven. James D. Watson and Francis took the credit for her findings after she had passed. </p>

                <br> Many people of color are underrepresented in STEM fields. This is especially true for people of Hispanic, African American, or Native American backgrounds. Women of color experience the intersection of discrimination based on their gender and race and are underrepresented compared to white men and women in STEM fields. “Many organizations have dedicated themselves toward promoting and advancing STEM education for girls including Girl Start, Girls WhoCode, and the National Girls Collaborative Project”.
                <br> People in STEM with disabilities are in the labor force, according to data from the NSF. However, the people with disabilities in the workforce make up roughly seventeen more percent than those who do not. Ultimately, having a disability makes it harder to retain employment in STEM.
                <br> Students with disabilities can face unique challenges in college, giving them an unequal disadvantage. Given the harsh environments that women in STEM majors already face, it’s important to make sure that women with disabilities are given all of the tools they need to reach success.
                <br> As veteran members are part of the armed forces, they are afforded opportunities to learn technical skills that are marketable and easily are able to be translated into college credits.They should be given more opportunities since a majority of them still decide to pursue other professions or desire to further their STEM education.
                <br> LGBTQ+ individuals often face discrimination and harsh environments in STEM fields. “However, while retention rates for gay men in STEM majors are lower than those of straight men, gay women were actually retained at a higher rate than straight women.” Women part of this minority group still face great discrimination, and their retention rates are below those for straight white men. STEM departments should provide resources for LGBTQ students to contribute to them feeling safe, protected, and respected in addition to their college education.

                    Although gender inequality reached its apex in the 1900s, and has improved over the years, females in STEM are still not receiving as many opportunities as males. Unless the current population strives to truly and genuinely resolve this issue, it will negatively impact the world’s future generations to come.
